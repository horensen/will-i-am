# will-i-am
A hack produced at Startup Weekend Mega 2017 in Singapore (29 Sep to 1 Oct 2017)

WillIAm is a concept of an automatic will generation for Singaporeans. By using their SingPass, a local password for transacting with various government agencies online, WillIAm automatically retrieves information about their assets such as insurance policies, real estates, CPF and HDB. Users then allocate assets to their beneficiaries and attach pictures of documents to prove ownership of assets to complete the creation of a will.
