WillIAm is a concept of an automatic will generation for Singaporeans. By using their SingPass, a local password for transacting with various government agencies online, WillIAm automatically retrieves information about their assets (e.g. insurance policies, real estates, CPF and HDB). Users will allocate assets to their beneficiaries and attach pictures of documents to prove ownership of assets before a will document will be automatically generated.
